# ubuntu-net-speed
A simple gnome shell extension that shows the current network speed that follows a mobile os like minimal approach.

## How the Minimal Approach Works

If you're a mobile phone user, you've probably seen network speeds displayed at the top of the status bar (similar to Android). You may have wondered why only a single speed is shown, instead of both upload and download speeds (e.g., `⬇ 320Kbps ⬆ 120Kbps`).

It’s actually a neat trick to minimize the clutter in the status bar. In this approach, **the single speed shown is a sum of both the upload and download speeds**. The arrow icon updates based on the values of upload and download speeds. Here's how it works:

### The 4 Possible Scenarios:
1. **Both Upload and Download Are Non-Zero:**
   - Both arrows (⬇ and ⬆) are displayed at full opacity, representing active upload and download speeds.

2. **Download Speed is Zero, but Upload is Non-Zero:**
   - The **up arrow** will be fully opaque, while the **down arrow** will be half opaque to indicate no download activity.

3. **Upload Speed is Zero, but Download is Non-Zero:**
   - The **down arrow** will be fully opaque, while the **up arrow** will be half opaque to indicate no upload activity.

4. **Both Upload and Download Are Zero:**
   - Both arrows are **fully transparent**, indicating no network activity.

### Summary of Logic:
- **Full opacity** for active speeds.
- **Half opacity** for inactive speeds.
- **Full transparency** when there’s no activity.
